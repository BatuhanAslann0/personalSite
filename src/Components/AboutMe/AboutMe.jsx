        <p>Hi again! I am a self taught frontend developer. <br />
        Let me tell you about myself a little more... <br />
        My passion is to improve myself, whatever I do I try to do it the best way I can. <br />
        My hobbies are dancing, playing or watching basketball, yoga and meditation, lifting weights or bodyweight training. <br />
        I played 7 years of basketball in the regional league between ages of 12-18. 
        I had to take a break from the basketball to study for university exam. <br />
        I was accepted to the department of Marine Engineering at Yıldız Technical University. <br />
        I was taking dance classes while I was studying Marine Engineering. <br />
        Then I decided to change my career and become a proffessional dance instructor, choreographer and stage dancer.
        After 3-4 years of teaching, hundreds of students, dozens of stages and commercials... <br />
        I decided to become a web developer. <br />
        And here I am, working hard every day to get a job that I really passionate about. <br />
